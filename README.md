# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset to uncover survival patterns based on demographic and socio-economic factors. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in Python-based data analysis, visualization, and insight communication for business and stakeholder contexts.

---

## 📁 Dataset Details
- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Records**: 891 passengers
- **Features**: Includes attributes such as `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`, `Embarked`, and `Cabin`.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and summary statistics
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis and documentation

---

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Inspection
- Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.isnull().sum()` to assess structure and missing values.

### 2. Univariate Analysis
- Histograms and countplots for `Age`, `Fare`, `Pclass`, and `Sex`.

### 3. Bivariate Analysis
- Barplots and boxplots to explore survival patterns by `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Age`, and `Fare`.

### 4. Multivariate Analysis
- Correlation heatmap and pairplot to identify numeric relationships and survival clusters.

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Gender Bias**: Females had significantly higher survival rates.
- **Class Divide**: 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
- **Fare Impact**: Higher fares correlated with better survival odds.
- **Age Factor**: Younger passengers had slightly better survival chances.
- **Missing Data**: Notable gaps in `Cabin`, `Age`, and `Embarked` require careful handling in future modeling.
